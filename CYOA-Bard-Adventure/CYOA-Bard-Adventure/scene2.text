You back out of the cave, not daring to turn your back to the dark entrance until you are a few dozen yards away. You look around to see what you can use to make a torch. An hour later you show up back at the cave entrance, having formed a torch from a broken tree limb and some flammable tree sap.  After taking a deep breath you proceed to enter the cave, walking deeper and deeper into its recesses until you can only see a glimmer of light that is the entrance when you look behind you. This is quite a long and big cave.

You come to a stop when, by the light of your torch, you see what looks like the back wall of the cave. You still can't see the ceiling. After a moment of looking around you spot a door set into the wall. It has a brass knocker on it. It looks ancient and flimsy. What do you do?

G. Try to door handle to open the door gently
B. Kick the door down with a mighty yell
N. Knock on the door with the brass knocker
