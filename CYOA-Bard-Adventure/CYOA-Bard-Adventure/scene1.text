Very well, (mainCharacterName). You are standing outside the designated cave. It took you half a day to travel here and it will take you half a day to get back. That means that instead of having 7 days to explore the cave, you have tonight and 6 more days. You were provided by your master some rations in a sack as well as an old, short spear to defend yourself with. You lick your lips nervously and, trembling, enter the cave.

There is light in the entrance to the cave, but you can see that further in it is pitch black. The ceiling is low at the entrance but it goes up higher and disappears further into the cave. What do you do?

Continue walking deeper into the cave despite the darkness
Go outside and fashion a torch
Shout a greeting and hope someone does (or does not) respond
