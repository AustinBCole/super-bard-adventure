You wisely take what you can get and stuff it into your pockets. You then retreat the way you came, looking behind you constantly to make sure that you are not being followed by any goblins. You make it out of the cave and journey back to your master. He is pleased and tells you of his plans to send you on another treasure hunt, this time with companions to aid you in securing more gems from the goblin stronghold.

You have won the game!
