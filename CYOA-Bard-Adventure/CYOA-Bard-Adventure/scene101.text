You continue walking deeper into the cave despite the darkness, using the butt of your spear to tap the ground in front and around you when it becomes too dark to see. You move slowly but despite your care you hit your forehead on a a hanging stalagmite. You let out a suprised yell of pain and grasp your forehead. You hit a sharp edge of the stalagmite and your head is bleeding. You take a step to your right to go around the obstacle but in you forget to check the ground with your spear. You fall into the pitch blackness, landing on the cave floor with a broken leg. You yell in pain and try to get up. You cannot support your weight and, while trying to create a split for your leg out of the spear in the absolute darkness, are killed and eaten by one of the cave's many man-eating denizens.
