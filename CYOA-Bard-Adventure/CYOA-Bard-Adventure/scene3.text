The door creaks as you gently push it. You think it is going to fall off of its hinges, but it doesn't.  You duck your head under the low doorway and step forward into a small, narrow passage, just tall enough for you to stand in. You begin to walk along the passage and a few yards later you meet its end. In front of you is a tapestry, and to either side a metal statue. One statue is of a severe-looking woman and the other is of a large crow.
You examine the tapestry more closely and see that it has some writing. It says:
"Woe to he who ventures near, but if you would enter then conquer fear. Two statues are on either side. One you must shun and one you must hide. The one you don't want forms a blood-thirsty group. That's all you get, now time to choose."

G. Take the tapestry off the wall and cover the crow with it.
B. Burn the tapestry with your torch
N. Take the tapestry off the wall and cover the woman with it.
